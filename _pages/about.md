Hi, I'm Ky! I'm a senior at UC Irvine studying Data Science and Language Science fortunately mentored by Greg Scontras and Richard Futrell. I'm fascinated by how humans and machines learn to understand abstract concepts and ground language in the real world. I've worked on this through Concept-ARC where I study how AI systems reason about space and objects. I'm also passionate about preserving endangered languages - I help document Pur√©pecha, a language spoken in Mexico. When I'm not doing research, you can find me trying to finish a book or making videos. I love making complex ideas accessible and helping others discover their passion for science!
